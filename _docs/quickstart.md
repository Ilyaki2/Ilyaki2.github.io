* Note: Goldberg Emulator, used by Nucleus, can sometimes be detected as a false positive by Windows Defender and some web browsers: see [here](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/issues/118). You may have to allow it as an exception before extracting.


* Move the NucleusCoop folder to wherever you like, and run NucleusCoop.exe
  * You can place the folder wherever you like as long as you keep the following in mind:

    * DO NOT place it inside a folder containing files for a game you wish to play.

    * Avoid placing it inside a folder that has security settings applied to it, such as Program Files, Program Files (x86).

    * Some scripts require the Nucleus Co-Op folder to be located in the same drive as the game files.

    * If you are still unsure where to place the folder, the root of the drive your games are installed on is usually the best option. For example C:/NucleusCoop

### Game setup

* Click the `Download Game Scripts` button and search for a script for the game you want to split screen.

* Click `Download`. When Nucleus asks to add the game, click Yes and browse to the game executable. Most Steam games will be in `C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\`

* Assign the devices to parts of the screen by dragging the devices. The device icons will light up when they receive input. Change the layout of each screen by clicking the icon in the top-left corner of each screen.

* Wait a bit for the games to start and their windows to be positioned. If you are using multiple keyboards and mice, you may have to press the End key to lock input after the games are set up (see the script notes).

* Follow the script guide to connect the games together.
